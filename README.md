# Bug-FFI-Bun

This is a minimalist project that aims to highlight an FFI execution issue in the Bun javascript runtime.

Run the bun index command several times if the bug does not appear immediately. On large projects, the bug in question prevents the project from running correctly.

This repository will be deleted once the problem is resolved.

The issue was discovered on an Ubuntu computer.
